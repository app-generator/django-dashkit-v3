<br />

## Prepare your environment

The product is built on top of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a popular Python Web Framework. To build the app, Python3 should be installed properly in the workstation. If you are not sure if Python is properly installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. The full-list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - the programming language used to code the app
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- A [Github](https://github.com/) account - the invitation to the source code, will be sent on your account.
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.

<br />

> Check Python (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check Python version
$ python --version
Python 3.7 # <--- All good
```

<br />

> Check GIT command tool (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check git
$ git --version
$ git version 2.10 # <--- All good
```

<br />

## Project Structure

The boilerplate code is built with a modular structure that follows the recommended pattern used by many open-source projects. The most important files and  directories are shown below:

<br />

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >                               # application root folder
    |
    |--- core/__init__.py                      # Handles the core features
    |--- core/                                 # define app settings and serve statis assets and pages
    |      | --- <templates>
    |      |        |---<includes>             # Page chunks, components
    |      |        |---<layouts>              # App Layouts (the master pages)
    |      |        |---<account>              # Auth Pages (login, register)
    |      |        |---<pages>                # App Pages
    |      |
    |      | --- views.py
    |      | --- urls.py
    |      | --- models.py
    |
    |--- app/__init__.py                       # Django app that serve the pages
    |--- app/                                  # for authenticated users
    |      | --- views.py
    |      | --- urls.py
    |      | --- models.py
    |
    |--- authentication/__init__.py            # Django app that serve the pages
    |--- authentication/                       # for authenticated users
    |      | --- forms.py                      # Login, Register forms
    |      | --- views.py
    |      | --- urls.py
    |      | --- models.py
    |
    |--- requirements.txt                      # Requirements - SQLite storage
    |
    |--- manage.py                             # bootstrap the app

$ heroku run python manage.py migrate
$
$ # Visit the deployed app in browser.
$ heroku open
$
$ # Create a superuser
$ heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

<br />

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) execution
---

The application can be easily executed in a docker container. The steps:

### What is [Django](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

[Django](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

<br />

### [What is dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

In information technology, a **[dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))** is a user interface that, somewhat resembling an automobile's dashboard, organizes and presents information in a way that is easy to read. However, a computer dashboard is more likely to be interactive than an automobile dashboard (unless it is also computer-based). To some extent, most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) resemble a dashboard - by [Techtarget](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/dashboard)

<br />

### [Dashkit UI PRO](https://cssninja.io/themes/dashkit)

Dashkit comes bundled with Bulkit as a dashboard starter kit. It offers some original styles and also a ctachy user profile. Design has been thought to give the best possible experience either on mobile and on desktop. Dashkit uses the Bulkit theming system, so you can change all colors in a breeze. Dashkit also uses some of Bulkit components. You can add more or remove those that you don't need.
